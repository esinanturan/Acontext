In the context of Acontext, we are trying to explore self-learning algorithms that can truly enhance the success rate of agents and can be used in production environments. 

In `v0.0`, we implemented a learning algorithm based on the [Notion philosophy](https://www.notion.com/blog/data-model-behind-notion), but it is still not perfect. 

We are developing a more general and filesystem-compatible self-learning algorithm in version `v0.1`.
